                This is the first post from a series on Think Tanks and Universities. In this post. Peter Taylor reflects on the challenges of selecting beneficiaries that apply for funding, which can include both think tanks and universities. As collaboration becomes an increasingly important element of knowledge generation, donors have to be careful that the relationship between think tanks and universities is not affected by competition for funds.
