# Blog Website - Think Tank
This was a coding test, which had me create a fully responsive blog website from a UX/UI design. This website which uses HTML, SASS, JavaScript & Responsive Design.

# Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer. The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me.
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page.
* Creating a website ASAP.
* Flexbox & layouts

# Challenges

* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Making each section of the page have the height and width of the ui/ux mockup.
* Making a dropdown menu for the 1st section.
