# Blog Website - Think Tank
This was a coding test, which had me create a fully responsive blog website from a UX/UI design. This website which uses HTML, SASS, JavaScript & Responsive Design.

# Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer. The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me.
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page.
* Creating a website ASAP.
* Flexbox & layouts.

# Challenges

* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Making each section of the page have the height and width of the ui/ux mockup.
* Making a dropdown menu for the 1st section.

# The approach I took for the task

* Breaking everything into sections. For example, every numbered row would be it's own section. This also included the introductory text above the first numbered section.

* Breaking each individual numbered section down to see if I could use flexbox for vertical and horizontal alignment. 

* Using flexbox to add space between elements. What helped was having a main container (e.g: section-1), and having a sub container within it (e.g: sub1-section1 / sub2-section1). 

* I named every numbered circle 'sub1'. In order to make it work, I used padding and position absolute with left, for responsive purposes.

* For the dropdown menu on section-1, I gave the section an id and grabbed it using JavaScript. I then followed up by adding a event listener, whereby once the user clicked the section a dropdown container which I had put on a dispay:none would appear underneath with some margin to avoid overlapping. 

* Using flexbox, but especially media queries to make sure that the website is responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop devices.
